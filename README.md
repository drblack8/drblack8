## Welcome to my GitHub

### My name is Dan and this is the home of most of my published work.

As someone who is curious by nature, the more difficult the problem, the more fulfilling it is to solve. Coupled with my enduring passion for technology, it was a matter of time that I'd find my self pursuing a career in software development. 

I do still have an ardent relationship with investing, but it became clear to me while working in the field, that what I really loved was the analytics and the algorithms involved in finding the gem in the rough. Introducing myself to programming was the single greatest choice I have made in my lifetime, as I've quickly realized there are an infinite number of problems to be solved and algorithms to be written.
